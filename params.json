{"name":"Perfect Prediction Equilibrium","tagline":"An alternative to the Nash Equilibrium","body":"### The Nash equilibrium is well established today\r\nDifferent people behave in different ways when they make decisions and interact with their peers. Non-cooperative game theory, in its modern state, began roughly sixty years ago when John Nash formalized the behavior of rational players and described the equilibrium they reach. Yet, Nash Equilibria do not account for all real life situations.\r\n\r\n### Two rationalities\r\n[Newcomb's problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_paradox) shows that people do not necessarily agree on what is rational to do. This problem points to two kinds of rationalities, Nash being one of them -- those who take two boxes. The PPE accounts for the rest of us who take only one box, on the same class of games (extensive form, perfect information, no random moves).\r\n\r\n### The papers\r\nSeveral papers have been published or put online. The [paper giving the philosophical foundations](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018632810498) of the PPE framework dates back to 2000 and conjectures the existence, uniqueness and Pareto-optimality of the PPE. The most recent paper confirms and proves this conjecture, and gives the complete game-theoretical and algorithmic description of the PPE. It is currently available on [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6172) and is being submitted to a journal.\r\n\r\n### Honesty is worth it\r\nOne of the nice take-away messages of the PPE is that it accounts for the behavior of honest people, yet in a non-cooperative framework. In particular, it leads to the optimal outcome of the promise game, in which Peter trusts Mary and Mary fulfils her promise. More general, the outcome of the PPE is always Pareto-optimal amongst the outcomes of the game.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
